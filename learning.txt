In this lesson we have used git config --global --list to ensure we have configured git

Reviewed pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, and code .

used git init to initialize git repo 

ls -a to view created git repo

used git status to view status of git (ensured it was ready to receive code)

used touch to create learning.txt

I am learning Git fundamentals.
Git tracks every change I make.
I can commit my work to save progress.
