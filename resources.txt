The Key Git Concepts 

Repository (Repo): A folder that Git is tracking. Contains your files plus Git's history.

Staging Area: A "waiting room" for changes before they become commits. You choose what to save together.

Commit: A snapshot of your project at a specific moment with a message describing what changed.

I'm using the key concepts of Git as one addition to this list.

The Repo, Staging Area, and Commit concepts are the key elements to understanding how Git works. It gives you a general understanding of "How Git works".

git add/ git commit 

These two commands are essential to Git and are the commands to move to the staging area and store code in the repo.

git init commands

I've included this command due to its imprtance in the Git process. Since it turns a folder into a Git repository, it is an essential command for any Git user. It creates a hidden .git folder that stores all history for the code on your machine.
